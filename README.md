# SuperMarket-Automation
SuperMarket Automation Project


Supermarket automation software (SAS): 
The manger of a supermarket wants us to 
develop an automation software. The supermarket stocks a set of items. Customers 
pick up their desired items from the different counters in required quantities. The 
customers present these items to the sales clerk. The sales clerk passes the items over 
a bar code reader and an automatic weighing scale and the data regarding the item 
type and the quantity get registered.
• SAS should at the end of a sales transaction print the bill containing the serial 
number of the sales transaction, the name of the item, code number, quantity, 
unit price, and item price. The bill should indicate the total amount payable.
• SAS should maintain the inventory of the various items of the supermarket. 
The manager upon query should be able to see the inventory details. In order 
to support inventory management, the inventory of an item should be 
decreased whenever an item is sold. SAS should also support an option by 
which an employee can update the inventory when new supply arrives.
• SAS should support printing the sales statistics for every item the supermarket 
deals with for any particular day or any particular period. The sales statistics 
should indicate the quantity of an item sold, the price realized, and the profit.
• The manager of the supermarket should be able to change the price at which 
an item is sold as the price of the different items vary on a day-to-day basis.
